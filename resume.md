> I'm a self taught Ruby on Rails web developer looking to make an impact as a junior in your organization. I've learned a lot on my own, but I know I have so much more to learn. I've used what I have learned on my own to build projects that I hope show off my skills. You can [check out my about me page](https://crespire.net) to see what I'm currently up to.
> I would love to have the opportunity to discuss what I can bring to the table, so please get in touch with me!
